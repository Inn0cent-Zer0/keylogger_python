## 🛡️ Keylogger Detection & Alert System (For Educational Purposes)

**⚠️ Disclaimer:**
This project is created **strictly for educational and research purposes only.** It is not intended for malicious use. The goal is to understand how keyloggers function and how to defend against them in a cybersecurity context.

### 📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates a simulated keylogger setup for **SOC (Security Operations Center) learning purposes**, focusing on:

* Sending keystroke logs securely via email (SMTP)
* Understanding the behavior of keylogging tools
* Practicing real-world SOC alert and detection scenarios
* Developing ethical awareness around cybersecurity misuse

---

### 💻 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* `pynput` for keyboard input
* `smtplib` for email sending
* `ssl` for secure connection
* Google App Password (for SMTP authentication)
* Optional: Clipboard access, screenshots (where applicable), microphone (testing phase)

---

### 🚀 Features

* ✅ Logs keystrokes
* ✅ Sends logs to email in intervals
* ✅ Basic clipboard capture
* ⚠️ Screenshot/microphone capture currently under testing
* 🔐 App password-based SMTP setup for safe transmission

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

* Working with **Python modules** like `pynput`, `smtplib`, `ssl`
* Setting up **Google App Passwords** securely
* Basics of **ethical hacking** and **SOC alert simulation**
* Respecting **ethical boundaries** in cybersecurity projects
* Logging, reporting, and maintaining transparency in testing
